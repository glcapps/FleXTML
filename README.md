# FleXTML
FleXTML is a dual-format UI structure that bridges JSON and XHTML. It provides a unified way to describe, render, and transmit UI components as both structured data and HTML fragments â€” ideal for APIs, HTMX responses, and server-rendered PHP components. FleXTML makes declarative rendering portable, introspectable, and framework-agnostic.
